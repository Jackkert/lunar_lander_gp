    "The coefficients in the multi-tree aren't optimised. Here Q-learning (taken from https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html) is used to optimise the weights further. Incorporate coefficient optimisation in training your agent(s). Coefficient Optimisation can be expensive. Think about how often you want to optimise, when, which individuals etc."

    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Bring more elaborated ideas (also taking inspiration from the scientific literature) about how the provided GP library could be improved using coefficient optimisation. Optimisation can be expensive, so consider what individuals or what portion of the population should be optimised. Important: At this stage, each idea should be formalised into a motivating hypothesis (e.g., “Assuming that . . . happens, then we expect an improvement by doing . . . ”.\n",

    "Mind here: programs in this case = multitrees\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas:\n",
    "1. Optimizing coefficients of the best multitree of each generation during evolution. Assuming that we optimize the coefficients of the best individual in a population, increasing the fitness, its offspring will also be fitter. We expect an improvement in \"convergence rate\" (fitness improves faster). This does not affect the global structure of the trees but the coefficients get \"propagated\"\n",
    "2. The same, but not the best of every generation to save compute.\n",
    "3. Optimize the coefficients on the worst individuals. Assume that the fitness increases to the point that the program will be included in the tournament selection. Then, this program is \"saved\" from being eliminated, and will perhaps evolve into a good (or best) solution. This is kind of like exploration, avoiding a pure greedy approach.\n",
    "4. Same reasoning for optimizing the number 2 or 3, or multiple programs, but that will be very expensive so probably not good.\n",
    "5. Inspired by paper: Coefficient Mutation in the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA). Use Gaussian coefficient mutation to mutate the coefficients to allow for more exploration, and fine-tuning solutions. This could be combined with optimizing while evolving for example. E.g. optimizing the best program and mutating it using gaussian coefficient mutation to create new programs. Then see if these programs are among the highest fitness to be selected by tournament selection. Assuming that this propagates the best solution while also exploring the solution (program) space, then this will ultimately lead to an overall better solution.\n",
    "6. Inspired by: Multi-objective Genetic Programming Optimization of Decision Trees for Classifying Medical Data. Use this technique that they are using to enhance their GP's coefficient optimization properties. But right now I don't have enough time to figure out what they did. ### TODO: LOOK AT PAPER. They state this: \"We have incorporated a Quasi-Newton optimization technique to augment the\n",
    "power ofthe GP coefficient optimization. This technique uses an error propaga-\n",
    "tion algorithm that efficiently calculates the gradient ofthe error function with\n",
    "respect to the coefficients embedded in the GP expression tree\""
